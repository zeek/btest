1.3 | 2026-01-07 10:36:41 -0700

  * Release 1.3.

1.2-24 | 2025-12-16 19:32:59 +0100

  * Run pre-commit run -a to fix formatting (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

    I didn't have pre-commit hooks on and master wasn't properly
    formatted, so doing it as a direct push.

1.2-23 | 2025-12-16 19:30:51 +0100

  * GH-122: Skip interpolation checks for non-selected alternative sections (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

    In #122 there's spurious stderr output for Spicy's test suite reported.
    This is due to the new code from #121 eagerly reading all keys in all
    sections, even if some, like [environment-<tag>] sections for
    alternatives, would never be used if not selected explicitly.

    Move the interpolation check below Options.alternative wrangling and
    skip sections that won't be used. This squelches the spurious stderr
    output. I've added a test, though it's a bit opaque.

1.2-21 | 2025-12-11 16:13:47 +0100

  * Add option to display progress via `OSC 9;4` escape codes. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    When running with `-P`/`--progress-bar` and the console is a TTY,
    btest now now signals test progress via OSC 9;4 escape codes.[^1] A
    number of terminal emulators support those these days, and those who
    don't should just be ignoring them.[^2]

    [^1] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/tutorials/progress-bar-sequences

    [^2] However, older versions of iTerm2 and Kitty (and maybe others)
    are known to end up triggering notifications for these escape codes
    instead of showing a progress bar.

1.2-19 | 2025-10-02 09:40:38 -0700

  * Check btest.cfg for Python configparser interpolation errors (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * GH-119: tests: Add env-var-default.test (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

1.2-15 | 2025-04-30 10:11:52 -0400

  * Allow executing tests from outside the suite (Evan Typanski, Corelight)

    If btest.cfg is in the `testing/btest` relative directory, this allows
    the user to call btest with `btest testing/btest/tests`, which will use
    the btest.cfg file in testing/btest. It will also check its parents, so
    you may use `btest testing/btest/language/while.zeek` - for example.

    The first complication is that previously-valid uses of btest should
    remain the same. This is done by always checking the current directory
    for btest.cfg first.

    The second is if there is a conflict between two tests' btest.cfg file.
    For example, the following may choose two different btest.cfg files:

    .
    └── multiple-cfg
        ├── Baseline
        ├── btest.cfg
        └── tests
            ├── no-cfg
            │   └── test2.test
            └── with-cfg
                ├── btest.cfg
                └── tests
                    └── test1.test

    If there is a conflicting config file, then btest should raise an error,
    as it can currently only execute with one config file per run.

  * Check if current directory has tests before erroring (Evan Typanski, Corelight)

    After this, btest can execute tests relative to the current directory.

  * Check parent directories for `btest.cfg` (Evan Typanski, Corelight)

1.2-11 | 2025-04-28 11:42:33 +0200

  * Enable lints around return statements (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

    This enables a class of return-related lints[^1] around return
    statements. I mainly came here for redundant returns after `else`[^2],
    but they all seemed useful. In general this seems to reduce nesting, and
    also make overall flow clearer.

1.2-9 | 2025-04-22 17:56:49 +0200

  * Bump pre-commit hooks (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

1.2-7 | 2025-03-20 10:09:16 +0100

  * Make btest-bg-run delay configurable (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

    Allow users to remove the unconditional sleep 1 by introducing
    a new environment variable BTEST_BG_RUN_SLEEP that specifies the
    amount of seconds to sleep. If tests are written robustly, setting
    this to 0 can speed up execution of btest-bg-run heavy test suites.

  * Make btest-bg-wait more responsive (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

    Sleep 10 msec instead of 1 second to check for process termination to
    make detecting process termination a bit more timely.

1.2-4 | 2025-01-29 09:03:57 -0700

  * Require CMake 3.15, inline with other Zeek projects (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

1.2-2 | 2025-01-21 09:08:38 -0700

  * Enforce using the right bash.exe on Windows (Tim Wojtulewicz)

1.2 | 2024-12-10 14:36:06 -0700

  * Fix formatting of output when threading (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Fix formatting bug with output of percentage complete (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

1.1-28 | 2024-12-05 12:37:47 -0700

  * Bump used GH actions (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Add python-3.13 to CI (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Bump pre-commit hooks (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Prefer format or f-strings over percent formatting (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

1.1-23 | 2024-12-04 19:18:04 +0100

  * btest-setsid: Fail on setsid() error (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

  * btest-bg-run-helper: Ignore SIGTERM to self during cleanup (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

    The kill 0 invocation would kill the btest-bg-run-helper itself,
    causing the subsequent logic to not be executed, resulting in
    runaway processes on the system.

1.1-20 | 2024-12-04 08:46:27 -0700

  * Fix ruff UP check findings (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Upgrade python requirement to 3.9 (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

1.1-17 | 2024-07-31 14:15:38 +0200

  * ci: Drop python-3.7, add python-3.12 (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

    Even though python-3.7 remains our minimal Python version it is not
    support by GH actions anymore so this commit drops it from CI. We also
    add a setup for the now released python-3.12.

  * Activate flake8-implicit-str-concat linter (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Activate isort linter (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Activate pyflakes linter (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

    We previously linted with flake8 so this contains no code changes.

  * Active linter for style around comprehensions (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Use ruff for pyupgrade functionality (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Move project configuration to `pyproject.toml` (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

    This centralizes most project configuration from `setup.py` and
    `setup.cfg` into the existing `pyproject.toml` so it can be picked up by
    more tools.

  * Bump pre-commit hooks (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

1.1-8 | 2024-04-10 09:35:28 -0700

  * Standardize on ruff for python formatting/linting via pre-commits (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

1.1-6 | 2024-01-09 09:16:00 +0100

  * Add option to read lists of tests from file. (Robin Sommer)

    ```
    -i FILE, --tests-file=FILE
        Loads the list of tests to execute from a file. Each line in the
        file is interpreted as the name of a test, or a group of tests, to
        execute, just like the tests would be specified on the command
        line. Empty lines and lines starting with ``#`` are ignored. (This
        format is compatible with that of the ``btest`` `StateFile
        <state_file_>`_.)
    ```

1.1-4 | 2023-10-04 11:30:31 +0200

  * Simplify generation of temporary files (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

    Instead of manuall relying in `$$` being unique, with this patch we
    instead use `mktemp` which creates a unique, temporary file which we can
    use later. This also removes the possibility that we accidentially
    overwrite other existing files in the final location, e.g., from
    previous, failed runs.

    Via the default behavior of `mktemp` with this patch we also switch from
    forced generation of temporary files in `/tmp` to possibly `$TMPDIR` if
    set.

1.1-2 | 2023-08-09 15:20:16 +0200

  * Bump pre-commit hooks. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

1.1 | 2023-07-05 09:52:44 -0700

  * Release 1.1.

1.0-12 | 2023-07-05 09:52:33 -0700

  * CI: automatically push to PyPI when pushing a git tag (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

1.0-10 | 2023-04-20 13:10:09 -0700

  * Add sphinx-related directory to gitignore (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Recognize "date" without nanosecond support in btest-progress (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Avoid diff --strip-trailing-cr since it's not available everywhere. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

1.0-6 | 2023-03-02 10:47:08 +0100

  * GH-60: Support environment variable removal in alternatives (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

1.0-4 | 2023-02-21 10:20:20 +0100

  * stderr/stdout: Do not assume well-formed UTF-8 output (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

    The previous code opened stdout/stderr providing an explicit encoding="utf-8"
    argument. This has no effect when the file handles are passed as stderr/stdout
    to a subprocess: Only the underlying fds are passed and there's no way to
    control the encoding (if any) used by the subprocess for the bytes it
    produces on these streams.

    So, switch things around: Remove the misleading encoding arguments for the
    stdout, stderr files, open them in binary mode and be careful when
    opening .stderr for displaying purposes. Do try UTF-8, but also set error
    strategy to "backslashreplace" to avoid errors.

  * monitor_cb: Start thread with daemon=True (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

    When an unexpected exception happened in a child process, nothing would
    stop the monitor_cb thread and in turn the child process would never
    finish. Use daemon=True on the monitor_cb thread to prevent this.

    There should never be unhandled exceptions in child processes, because
    it may then not close all resources properly etc, but a non-terminating
    btest is worse, specifically when btest is run in CI unattended.

1.0 | 2023-02-01 16:07:31 -0700

  * Release 1.0.

0.72-71 | 2023-02-01 16:07:09 -0700

  * Fix test cloning bug that caused "subtests" to run without numeric suffix (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    When running with retries, failing tests created via @TEST-START-NEXT were
    cloned for retry in a way that lost their numeric suffix, which could cause
    btest to consult the wrong baselines.

  * Add testcase for retried subtests (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    This highlights a bug in which a subtest (via @TEST-START-NEXT) other than the
    first always gets retried as the first, but with the wrong baseline.

0.72-68 | 2023-01-31 18:29:53 -0800

  * Automated code formatting and modernization (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    - Final touches on top of automated reformatting.
    - setup.cfg/pre-commit-config: Add flake8 hook and config
    - Minor tweaks in preparation for flake8
    - Automatically update Python sources to use python-3.7 syntax
    - Minor tweaks to clue in pyupgrade
    - Add `.git-blame-ignore-revs` file.
    - Reformat Python code with Black.
    - Minor Python tweaks in anticipation of reformatting
    - Minor indentation tweak in pre-commit config
    - Modernize action versions in pre-commit workflow
    - Don't ignore the sphinx folder, it has revision-controlled content
    - Remove unused .travis.yml setup

0.72-55 | 2023-01-25 16:06:26 -0800

  * Whitespace-align the thread prefixes in output handlers (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Prevent output garbling when running with "-A -j" (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Switch Console and CompactConsole to using base class's output file member (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Make OutputHandler's default output file a constructor argument (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Prevent console.test from garbling output (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Comment-only tweaks, no other change (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

0.72-48 | 2023-01-13 15:53:55 -0700

  * Add Windows Caveats to README, add bash.exe check at startup (Tim Wojtulewicz)

  * Add tests.environment-windows btest (Tim Wojtulewicz)

    The original tests.environment btest doesn't work on Windows due to some
    path differences in the output. This adds a new test that does the same
    things except does some additional conversions in the test script itself
    to remove those differences.

  * Open .stdout and .stderr in append mode (Tim Wojtulewicz)

    This fixes a problem on Windows where multiple TEST-EXEC statements in a
    test could cause those files to be overwritten by subsequent TEST-EXECs,
    causing failures.

  * Fix tests.multiple-baseline-dirs btest to use pathsep (Tim Wojtulewicz)

  * Fix strip-test-base script to handle Windows paths correctly (Tim Wojtulewicz)

  * Fix diff-remove-abspath to handle Windows drive letters (Tim Wojtulewicz)

  * Add testing script to check for Windows, use it to disable some tests (Tim Wojtulewicz)

  * Return error if trying to use Sphinx features on Windows (Tim Wojtulewicz)

  * Force output to use unix-style line endings for consistency (Tim Wojtulewicz)

  * Use binascii.crc32 for computing hashes for TEST-SERIALIZE commands (Tim Wojtulewicz)

    Windows has some issue where `hash()` returns different values for the
    same string in the different child processes. crc32() returns the same
    values in each.

  * Rework how test processes are called on Windows (Tim Wojtulewicz)

    This changes how runSubprocess works on Windows to insert all of the
    calls within a temporary bash script. This ensures that the entire
    environment is available when running the processes, which doesn't
    work when simply calling subprocess.check_call().

  * Fix an error when attempting to delete the tmp dirs on Windows (Tim Wojtulewicz)

  * Rebuild globals() table in child processes on Windows (Tim Wojtulewicz)

    Using the 'spawn' method for multiprocessing causes the global
    state to get lost when moving from the parent into the child
    processes. Rebuilding it by looping over a subset and reinserting
    them into globals() ensures that they exist.

  * Move option parsing to a method (Tim Wojtulewicz)

  * Use named pipes on Windows since AF_UNIX is not supported (Tim Wojtulewicz)

  * Fix running tests with dot-notation for their name (Tim Wojtulewicz)

  * Add method for normalizing paths on both Windows and POSIX (Tim Wojtulewicz)

  * Avoid isinstance() to determine whether a cmd is a CmdSeq (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    As per the comment, some serializer/unserializers don't produce the identical
    type when unserializing, failing isinstance().

  * Add -s/--set command-line argument for overriding config defaults (Tim Wojtulewicz)

  * Switch to https://pypi.org/project/multiprocess/ on Windows (Tim Wojtulewicz)

    The reason for this switch is primarily because the stock
    multiprocessing library has very poor support for pickling of
    non-primitive types on Windows.

  * Move outputhandler creation to separate function (Tim Wojtulewicz)

  * Rename WSL bash so it doesn't override Git bash for Windows CI builds (Tim Wojtulewicz)

  * Set git's autocrlf option to false when running tests on Github (Tim Wojtulewicz)

    If this option isn't here, the Windows runners will reset all of the
    line endings when it clones to \r\n. This breaks a few of the tests
    because the comparison will have the wrong line endings.

  * Bump required python version to 3.7, update github workflows (Tim Wojtulewicz)

    This also adds a new workflow to test setup.py to ensure that the
    package installs correctly and you can run the internal tests against
    the installed version.

0.72-20 | 2022-12-13 09:12:13 +0100

  * Add back CI run for Python 3.5. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Explain recent alternatives-related changes in the README. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Fix handling of specific alternatives in combination with the default (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Fail when -a/--alternative includes an alternative not defined in the config (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Add test for use of an undefined alternative (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

0.72-10 | 2022-11-16 14:44:01 +0100

  * Always use UTF-8 encoding for BTest input and output files.
    (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.72-7 | 2022-11-16 10:23:44 +0100

  * Python cleanup (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

    - Use `locale.getlocale` instead of deprecated `locale.getdefaultlocale`.

    - Remove code for Python 2 compatibility.

    - Use `python3` instead of `python` binary in test. Newer versions
      of e.g., macOS do not provide a `python` binary anymore.

  * Bump pre-commit checks. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.72-2 | 2022-11-08 10:34:21 +0100

  * Remove dependency on distutils. The distutils module will be
    removed from Python in 3.12. (Cyril Rolando)

  * Release 0.72.

0.71-4 | 2022-03-22 09:19:53 +0100

    Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Clean up registered temp files in btest-rst-cmd (Christian Kreibich,
    Corelight)

  * Remove uses of deprecated `distutils` package. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.69-25 | 2021-10-08 11:55:13 +0200

  * Improve backtick expansion in `btest.cfg`. Instead of naive
    splitting of the command string into arguments, pass the command
    as-is to a subshell for parsing. Note that this changes semantics
    of backticks slightly. However, they were ill-defined to begin
    with. (DJ Gregor, Corelight)

  * Minor README tweaks. (DJ Gregor, Corelight)

0.69-22 | 2021-09-24 10:57:31 +0200

  * Reformat Python scripts with yapf. (Benjamin Bannier)

  * Reformat shell scripts with shellfmt. (Benjamin Bannier)

  * Fix a couple issues tagged by shellcheck. (Benjamin Bannier)

  * More precise environment filtering in
    local-alternative-show-env.test. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Fix parallel/interleaved execution between the test wrapup
    functions (such as testSucceeded) and the progress monitor.
    (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Switch Sphinx build test to use "text" output format. (Christian
    Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Add GitHub action exercising the test suite. (Benjamin Bannier,
    Corelight)

  * Make `btest-progress` more robust under concurrency. (Benjamin

0.69 | 2021-06-07 09:33:51 +0200

  * Release 0.69.

0.68-9 | 2021-06-07 09:31:03 +0200

  * Documentation updates. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    - Add a section on running btest, to give some basic context.
    - Add more detail on btest invocation and test selection.
    - Update docs for download and installation, shifting focus to PyPI.
    - Move TEST-START-NEXT description to its section.

    changing testbase. (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

0.68-2 | 2021-06-01 08:53:42 +0200

  * Fix issue where global configuration object wasn't updated for
    environment variables taken from alternatives. (Arne Welzel,

0.68 | 2021-04-16 16:21:36 -0700

  * Release 0.68.

0.67-2 | 2021-04-16 16:21:14 -0700

  * Preserve CRLF line-terminators in test files (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Since the test itself may depend on their existence.

    Related to https://github.com/zeek/zeek/issues/1497

0.67 | 2021-01-21 13:27:20 -0800

  * Release 0.67.

0.66-2 | 2021-01-21 13:26:58 -0800

  * Support BTest installation via CMake (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    This copies the relevant files manually. Relying on setup.py is
    feasible but requires careful separation of build and source
    directories, so currently explicit file lists are easier to maintain.

0.66 | 2021-01-08 12:14:24 +0000

  * Bug fix to apply TEST-REQUIRES to tests duplicated with TEST-START-NEXT.
    (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.65 | 2020-12-07 09:32:03 +0000

  * Release 0.65.

0.64-21 | 2020-12-07 09:01:13 +0000

  * Default to `-j 1` to make CTRL-C work consistently. We now always use
    multiprocessing with a single process, with one exception: interactive
    baseline updates still run directly. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Avoid leaking processes due to lacking sync manager shutdown.
    (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Speed up the threading test since its built-in delays weren't actually
    required for the test. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

0.64-18 | 2020-12-07 08:44:55 +0000

  * Add "binary mode" to btest-diff. In binary mode, invoked with -b/--binary,
    btest-diff compares test output and baselines for equality only, never
    applies canonifiers, and doesn't apply our btest header when updating
    baselines. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

0.64-16 | 2020-12-07 08:35:25 +0000

  * GH-36: Fix --abort-on-failure for expected failures. (Robin Sommer,
    Corelight)

0.64-14 | 2020-12-01 16:05:25 +0000

  * Add support for multiple baseline directories. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    This works be setting the environment variable BTEST_BASELINE_DIR to a
    colon-separated list of directories. They will be searched in order when
    looking a baseline file to compare against. Updating a baseline will always
    put the new content into the first directory. One can now also generally
    set a different baseline directory through BTEST_BASELINE_DIR. See the
    README for more.

  * Require Python >= 3.5. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

0.64-1 | 2020-11-11 12:57:12 +0000

  * Fix for Python 3. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.64 | 2020-10-20 14:02:01 +0000

  * Fix canonification problem. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.63 | 2020-10-20 08:32:28 +0000

  * Add support for minimum BTest version requirement in the config
    file. If an entry called "MinVersion" is present in the "btest"
    section, it spells out a minimum version that BTest must have in
    order to run. If that condition isn't fulfilled, we exit with
    error code 1 and a corresponding error message on stderr.
    (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * GH-29: Add new options -F/--abort-on-failure that will abort once
    at least one test has failed. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Documentation and code cleanup. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

0.62-13 | 2020-10-09 07:33:49 +0000

  * Canonify outputs when updating baselines via btest-diff.
    (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    This leverages the same canonicalization btest-diff already
    applies during test output comparison against baselines also when
    updating those baselines (usually via btest -U/-u). This removes a
    bunch of noise from the baselines, including personal home
    directories, timestamps, etc.

    Since btest-diff doesn't know whether the baseline has undergone
    this canonicalization, it continues to canonicalize the baseline
    prior to diffing. To track whether it has canonicalized a baseline
    when updating, btest-diff now also prepends a header to the
    generated baseline that warns users about the fact that it is
    auto-generated. The presence of this header doubles as a marker
    for canonicalization.

  * Clean up btest-diff's shell code. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

0.62-7 | 2020-09-24 07:47:26 -0700

  * GH-26: Explicitly use multiprocessing "fork" start-method (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The default start-method on macOS in Python 3.8+ is "spawn", but that
    emits a RuntimeError with current btest structuring.

0.62-5 | 2020-08-25 07:57:23 +0000

  * GH-11: Fix %DIR not being set correctly in cloned tests. (Jon
    Siwek, Corelight)

  * Sort XML attributes for more output stability across Python
    versions. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Use Sphinx logging API directly for compatibility with Sphinx
    2.0+. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

0.62 | 2020-05-08 15:07:11 +0000

  * Release 0.62.

0.61-10 | 2020-05-08 15:05:46 +0000

  * Catch keyboard interrupt to abort orderly and immediately. The

    (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.61-8 | 2020-04-28 10:00:41 +0000

  * Add `--trace-file` option for recording Chrome trace file.
    (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.61-2 | 2020-02-13 18:53:41 +0000

  * Provide a more apt description for btest. (Christopher M. Hobbs,
    Corelight)

    that are expected to. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Extend XML test case to cover -j flag. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix XML output option -x to work with -j. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

0.59-12 | 2019-09-09 11:30:26 +0000

  * Add timestamps to "btest-progress" output. They are added to
    stderr only, so that they will get recorded but not displayed
    during execution. The new option -T suppresses the timestamp. (DJ
    Gregor, Corelight)

0.59-8 | 2019-08-16 16:15:41 +0000

0.58-4 | 2018-11-29 16:55:33 -0600

  * Add TEST-PORT command and PortRange option (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    These control assignment of TCP ports to environment variables for
    use during test execution.  Helps in writing unit tests that can be
    run concurrently or just in reducing the risk of a unit test failing
    due to a port already being used by some external process.

0.58 | 2018-05-21 22:32:21 +0000

  * Release 0.58.

          to delete any content that a previous, longer message may
          have left.

        - Ensure to turn the cursor back on at exit.

  * Bugfix for recent btest-progress changes. (Robin Sommer)

0.56-4 | 2017-01-23 19:59:59 -0800

  * New utility btest-progress to display progress messages while a
    test is executing. These messages appear in real-time while the
    rest is still running. When stdout is a tty, the progress messages
    are incorporated into the colored one-line status message. By
    default, btest-progress also prints the message to a test's
    standard output. That can be suppressed by giving it an option -q.
    (Robin Sommer)

  * Experimental automatic generation of test reference documentation.
    The new command-line option "-R <format>" prints out a list of all
    tests in either Markdown (format 'md') or reStructuredText (format
    'rst'). The list includes a documentation string with each test
    that gets defined through a new "@TEST-DOC: <docstring>"
    directive. This is experimental. (Robin Sommer)

    to show for diffs by setting the environment variable
    TEST_DIFF_FILE_MAX_LINES. Reduced the default to 100. (Daniel
    Thayer)

  * When no baseline exists, changed btest-diff to always just show
    the entire file. (Daniel Thayer)

    (Robin Sommer)

0.51-6 | 2014-02-06 18:19:08 -0800

  * Adding a timing mode that records test execution times per host.
    This is for catching regressions (or improvements :) that lets
    execution times divert significantly. Linux only for now. See the
    README for more information. (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding color to test status when writing to console. (Robin Sommer)

  * A bit of refactoring to define the status messages ("ok", "failed")
    only at a single location.

    Also added a note when a test declared as expecting failure in fact
    succeeds. (Robin Sommer)


0.51-2 | 2013-11-17 20:21:08 -0800

          via the new "btest-include" and "btest-cmd" classes.

        - Fix to enable showing line numbers in btest-sphinx generated
          output.

  * A set of of documentation fixes, clarifications, and extensions.
    (Daniel Thayer)

  * A set of changes to Sphinx commands and directives. (Robin Sommer)

    btest-rst-*:
        - Always show line numbers.

        - Highlight the command executed.

        - rst-cmd-include gets an option -n <i> to include only upto i lines.

        - rst-cmd-include prefixes output with "<file>" to show what we're
          including.

    btest-include:
        - Set Pygments language automatically if we show a file with an
          extension we know (in particular ".bro").

        - Prefix output with "<file>" to show what we're including.

0.4-63 | 2013-08-28 21:10:39 -0700

  * btest-sphinx now provides a new directive btest-include. This
    works like literalinclude (with all its options) but it also saves
    a version of the included text as a test to detect changes. (Robin
    Sommer)

0.4-60 | 2013-08-28 18:54:51 -0700

  * Fix typos and reST formatting in README (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix a couple of error messages. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fixed a reference to a non-existent variable which was causing the
    "-w" option to have no effect. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Test portability fix.  (Robin Sommer)

0.4-55 | 2013-08-22 16:09:21 -0700

  * New "Sphinx-mode" for BTest, activated with -S. This allows to
    capture a test's diagnostic output when running from inside
    Sphinx; the output will now be inserted into the generated
    document. (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding an option -n to btest-rst-cmd that truncates output longer
    than N lines. (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding a PartFinalizer that runs a commmand at the completion of
    each test part. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-51 | 2013-08-22 10:36:34 -0700

  * Improve cleanup of processes that don't terminate with
    btest-bg-wait. (Jon Siwek)

0.4-49 | 2013-08-13 18:43:03 -0700

  * Fixing test portability problems. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Adding TEST_BASE environment variable. The existing TESTBASE isn't
    always behaving as expected and wasn't documented to begin with.
    (Robin Sommer)

0.4-43 | 2013-08-12 16:04:53 -0700

  * Bugfix for ignored tests. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-42 | 2013-07-31 20:46:30 -0700

  * Adding support for "parts": One can split a single test across
    multiple files by adding a numerical ``#<n>`` postfix to their
    names, where each ``<n>`` represents a separate part of the test.
    ``btests`` will combine all of a test's parts in numerical order
    and execute them subsequently within the same sandbox. Example in
    the README. (Robin Sommer)

  * When running a command, TEST_PART contains the current part
    number. (Robin Sommer)

  * Extending Sphinx support. (Robin Sommer)

        * Adding tests for Sphinx functionality.

        * Support for parts in Sphinx directives. If multiple btest
          directives reference the same test name, each will turn into
          a part of a single test.

        * Internal change restructuring the btest Sphinx directive. We
          now process it in two passes: one to save the test at parse
          time, and one later to execute once everything has been
          parsed.

        * Adding Sphinx sandbox for testing.

  * Fix for tests returning no output to render at all. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-28 | 2013-07-17 21:56:18 -0700

  * btest-diff now passes the name of the file under consideration on to
    canonifiers. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-27 | 2013-07-14 21:19:59 -0700

  * When searching for tests, BTest now ignores a directories if it finds
    a file ".btest-ignore" in there. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-26 | 2013-07-08 20:46:22 -0700

  * Fixing bug with @TEST-START-NEXT naming. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-25 | 2013-07-08 13:25:50 -0700

  * A test-suite for btest. Using, of course, btest. "make test" will
    test most of btest's features. The main missing piece is testing
    the Sphinx support, we will add that next. (Robin Sommer)

  * When creating directories, we know also create intermediaries.
    That in particular means that "@TEST-START-FILE a/b/c" now creates
    a directory "a/b" automatically and puts the file in there. (Robin
    Sommer)

  * IgnoreDirs now also works for sub directories. (Robin Sommer)

  * Documentation updates. (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding "Initializer" option, which runs a command before each
    test. (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding "CommandPrefix" option that changes the naming of all btest
    commands by replacing the "@TEST-" prefix with a custom string.
    (Robin Sommer)

  * Default configuration file can be overriden via BTEST_CFG
    environment variable. (Robin Sommer)

  * s/bro-ids.org/bro.org/g (Robin Sommer)

  * Bugfix for -j without number. (Robin Sommer)

  * New @TEST-ALTERNATIVE that activates tests only for the given
    alternative. Renamed @TEST-NO-ALTERNATIVE to
    @TEST-NOT-ALTERNATIVE, and allowing "default" for both
    @TEST-ALTERNATIVE and @TEST-NOTALTERNATIVE to specify the case
    that BTest runs without any alternative given. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fix for alternative names containing white spaces. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-14 | 2013-01-23 18:11:22 -0800

  * Fixing links in README and removing TODOs. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-13 | 2013-01-23 14:33:23 -0800

  * Allowing use of -j without a value. BTest then uses the number of
    CPU cores as reported by the OS. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-11 | 2013-01-21 17:50:40 -0800

  * Adding a new "alternative" concept that combines filters and
    substitutions, and adds per-alternative environment variables.
    (Robin Sommer)

    Instead of defining filters and substitutions separately, one now
    specifies an alternative configuration to run with "-A <name>" and
    that then checks for both "[substitutions-<name>]" and
    "[filter-<name>]" section. In addition, "[environment-<name>]"
    allows to define alternative-specific environment variables.

    The old filter/substitutions options -F and -s are gone. The
    sections for substitutions are renamed to "[substitutions-<name>]"
    from "[subst-<name>]".

0.4-10 | 2013-01-07 09:45:35 -0800

  * btest now sets a new environment variable TEST_VERBOSE, giving the
    path of a file where a test can record further information about
    its execution that will be included with btest's ``--verbose``
    output. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-9 | 2012-12-20 12:20:44 -0800

  * Documentation fixes/clarifications. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix the btest "-c" option, which didn't work when the specified
    config file was not in the current working directory. (Daniel
    Thayer)

0.4-6 | 2012-11-08 16:33:51 -0800

  * Putting a limit on how many input line btest-diff shows. (Robin
    Sommer)

0.4-5 | 2012-11-01 16:14:29 -0700

  * Making Sphinx module tolerant against docutils version change.
    (Robin Sommer)

0.4-4 | 2012-09-25 06:24:59 -0700

  * Fix a couple of reST formatting problems. (Daniel Thayer)

0.4-2 | 2012-09-24 11:41:06 -0700

  * Add option -x to output test results in an XML (JUnit-like)
    format. (Jon Siwek)

0.4 | 2012-06-15 15:15:13 -0700

  * Remove code to expand environment variables on command line. (Not
    needed because the command line is just passed to the shell.)
    (Daniel Thayer)

  * Clarify explanation about expansion of environment variables.
    (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix errors in README and btest help output; added documentation
    for the -q option. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fixed a bug in btest where it was looking for "filters-" (instead
    of "filter-") in the btest config file. (Daniel Thayer)

0.31-45 | 2012-05-24 16:43:14 -0700

  * Correct typos in documentation. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Failed tests are now only recorded into the state file when we're
    not updating. That allows to run "btest -r" repeatedly while
    updating baselines in between. (Robin Sommer)

  * Experimentation Sphinx directive to write a btest with a Sphinx
    document. See README for more information.

  * Fixing typos, plus an console output tweak. (Robin Sommer)

  * Option -q now implies -b as well. (Robin Sommer)

0.31-33 | 2012-05-13 17:08:15 -0700

  * New command to copy a file into a test's directory.

    ``@TEST-COPY-FILE: <file>``
        Copy the given file into the test's directory before the test is
        run. If ``<file>`` is a relative path, it's interpreted relative
        to the BTest's base directory. Environment variables in ``<file>``
        will be replaced if enclosed in ``$
	{
	..
	}``. This command can be
        given multiple times. (Robin Sommer)

  * Suppressing error messages when btest-diff can't remove diag file.
    (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding option -q/--quiet to suppress informational non-error
    output. (Robin Sommer)

  * Option -F also takes a comma-separated list to specify multiple
    filters , rather than having to give -F multiple times. (Robin
    Sommer)

0.31-28 | 2012-05-06 21:27:15 -0700

  * Separating semantics of groups and thread serialization into
    separate options. -g still specifices @TEST-GROUPs that are to be
    executed, but these groups don't any longer control which tests
    get serialized in a parallel execution. For that, there's a new
    "@TEST-SERIALIZE: <tag>" command that takes a tag and then makes
    sure all tests with the same tag are run within the same thread.
    (Robin Sommer)

  * TEST-GROUPS can now be given multiple times now to assign a test
    to a set of groups. (Robin Sommer)

  * Extended -g to accept a comma-separated list of groups names to
    run more than one test group. (Robin Sommer)

  * New output handler for console output. This output is now the
    default when stdout is a terminal. It prints out a compressed
    output that updates as btest goes through; it also indicates the
    progress so far. If btest's output is redirected to a
    non-terminal, is switches back to the old style. (Robin Sommer)

  * New test command @TEST-NO-FILTER: <filter>

    This allows to ignore a test when running a specific filter. (Robin Sommer)

  * Changing the way filters are activated.

    -F <filter> now activates only the given filter, but doesn't run
    the standard tests in addition. But one can now give -F a
    command-separated list of filters to activate them all, and refer
    to the standard tests without filter as ``-``. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fix to allow numbered test to be given individually on the command
    line. (E.g., integer.geq-3 for a file that contains three tests).
    (Robin Sommer)


0.31-23 | 2012-04-16 18:10:02 -0700

  * A number of smaller fixes for bugs, plus polishing, caused by the
    recent restructuring. (Robin Sommer)

  * Removing the error given when using -r with tests on the command
    line. It's unnessary and confusing compared to when listing tests
    in btest.cfg. (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding a new "finalizer" option.

    ``Finalizer``
        An executable that will be executed each time any test has
        succesfully run. It runs in the same directory as the test itself
        and receives the name of the test as its parameter. The return
        value indicates whether the test should indeed be considered
        succeeded. By default, there's no finalizer set. (Robin Sommer)

  * btest is now again overwriting old diag files instead of appending
    (i.e., back to as it used to be). (Robin Sommer)

  * Diag output is now line-buffered. (Daniel Thayer)


0.31-13 | 2012-03-13 15:59:51 -0700

  * Adding new option -r that reruns all tests that failed last time.
    btest now always records all failed tests in a file called. (Robin
    Sommer)

  * Internal restructuring to factor output out into sublcasses.
    (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding parallel test execution to btest. (Robin Sommer)

        - A new option "-j <n>" allows to run up to <n> tests in
          parallel.

        - A new @TEST-GROUP directive allows to group tests that can't
          be parallelized. All tests of the same group will be
          executed sequentially.

        - A new option "-g <group>" allows to run only tests of a
          certain group, or with "-g -" all tests that don't have a
          group.


0.31-2 | 2012-01-25 16:58:29 -0800

  * Don't add btest's path to PATH anymore. (Jon Siwek)

0.31 | 2011-11-29 12:11:49 -0600

  * Submodule README conformity changes. (Jon Siwek)

0.3 | 2011-10-25 19:58:26 -0700

  * More graceful error handling at startup if btest.cfg not found.
    (Robin Sommer)

  * Python 2.4 compat changes. (Jon Siwek)

  * When in brief mode, btest-diff now shows full output if we don't
    have a baseline yet. (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding executable permission back to script. (Robin Sommer)

  * Cleaning up distribution. (Robin Sommer)

0.22-28 | 2011-09-15 15:18:11 -0700

  * New environment variable TEST_DIFF_BRIEF. If set btest-diff no
    longer includes a mismatching file's full content it the
    diagnostic output. This can be useful if the file being compared
    is very large. (Robin Sommer)

0.22-27 | 2011-08-12 22:56:12 -0700

  * Fix btest-bg-wait's kill trap and -k option. (Jon Siwek)

0.22-18 | 2011-07-23 11:54:07 -0700

  * A new option -u for interactively updating baselines.

  * Teach btest's TEST-START-FILE to make subdirectories (Jon Siwek)

  * Output polishing. (Robin Sommer)

  * Have distutils install 'btest-setsid' script. (Jon Siwek)

  * A portable setsid. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fixes for background execution of processes.

  * Fixing exit codes. (Robin Sommer)

0.22-6 | 2011-07-19 17:38:03 -0700

  * Teach btest's TEST-START-FILE to make subdirectories (Jon Siwek)

0.22-5 | 2011-05-02 08:41:34 -0700

  * A number of bug fixes, and output polishing. (Robin Sommer)

  * More robust background execution by btest-bg-*. (Robin Sommer)

0.22-4 | 2011-03-29 21:38:13 -0700

  * A test command can now signal to btest that even if it fails
    subsequent test commands should still run by returning exit code 100.
    btest-diff uses this to continue in the case that no baseline has
    yet been established.

  * New test option @TEST-REQUIRES for running a test conditionally.
    See the README for more information.

0.22-2 | 2011-03-03 21:44:18 -0800

  * Two new helper scripts for spawning processes in the background.
    See README for more information.

  * btest-diff can now deal with files specificied with paths.

0.22 | 2011-02-08 14:06:13 -0800

  * BTest is now hosted along with the other Bro repositories on
    git.bro-ids.org.

0.21 | 2011-01-09 21:29:18 -0800

  * In btest.cfg, option values can now include commands to execute in
    backticks.

    Example:

        [environment]
        CC=clang -emit-llvm -g `hilti-config --cflags`

  * Limiting substitutions to replacing whole words.

  * Adding "substitutions". Substitutions are similar to filters, yet
    they do not adapt the input but the command line being exectued.
    See README for more information.

  * Instead of giving a test's file name on the command line, one can
    now also use its "dotted" name as it's printed out when btest is
    running (e.g., "foo.bar"). That allows for easier copy/paste.

  * Starting CHANGES.
