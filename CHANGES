  * Separating semantics of groups and thread serialization into
    separate options. -g still specifices @TEST-GROUPs that are to be
    executed, but these groups don't any longer control which tests
    get serialized in a parallel execution. For that, there's a new
    "@TEST-SERIALIZE: <tag>" command that takes a tag and then makes
    sure all tests with the same tag are run within the same thread.
    (Robin Sommer)

  * TEST-GROUPS can now be given multiple times now to assign a test
    to a set of groups. (Robin Sommer)

  * Extended -g to accept a comma-separated list of groups names to
    run more than one test group. (Robin Sommer)

  * New output handler for console output. This output is now the
    default when stdout is a terminal. It prints out a compressed
    output that updates as btest goes through; it also indicates the
    progress so far. If btest's output is redirected to a
    non-terminal, is switches back to the old style. (Robin Sommer)

  * New test command @TEST-NO-FILTER: <filter>
    
    This allows to ignore a test when running a specific filter. (Robin Sommer)

  * Changing the way filters are activated.

    -F <filter> now activates only the given filter, but doesn't run
    the standard tests in addition. But one can now give -F a
    command-separated list of filters to activate them all, and refer
    to the standard tests without filter as ``-``. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fix to allow numbered test to be given individually on the command
    line. (E.g., integer.geq-3 for a file that contains three tests).
    (Robin Sommer)


0.31-23 | 2012-04-16 18:10:02 -0700

  * A number of smaller fixes for bugs, plus polishing, caused by the
    recent restructuring. (Robin Sommer)

  * Removing the error given when using -r with tests on the command
    line. It's unnessary and confusing compared to when listing tests
    in btest.cfg. (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding a new "finalizer" option.
    
    ``Finalizer``
        An executable that will be executed each time any test has
        succesfully run. It runs in the same directory as the test itself
        and receives the name of the test as its parameter. The return
        value indicates whether the test should indeed be considered
        succeeded. By default, there's no finalizer set. (Robin Sommer)

  * btest is now again overwriting old diag files instead of appending
    (i.e., back to as it used to be). (Robin Sommer)

  * Diag output is now line-buffered. (Daniel Thayer)


0.31-13 | 2012-03-13 15:59:51 -0700

  * Adding new option -r that reruns all tests that failed last time.
    btest now always records all failed tests in a file called. (Robin
    Sommer)

  * Internal restructuring to factor output out into sublcasses.
    (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding parallel test execution to btest. (Robin Sommer)
    
        - A new option "-j <n>" allows to run up to <n> tests in
          parallel.

        - A new @TEST-GROUP directive allows to group tests that can't
          be parallelized. All tests of the same group will be
          executed sequentially.

        - A new option "-g <group>" allows to run only tests of a
          certain group, or with "-g -" all tests that don't have a
          group.


0.31-2 | 2012-01-25 16:58:29 -0800

  * Don't add btest's path to PATH anymore. (Jon Siwek)

0.31 | 2011-11-29 12:11:49 -0600

  * Submodule README conformity changes. (Jon Siwek)

0.3 | 2011-10-25 19:58:26 -0700

  * More graceful error handling at startup if btest.cfg not found.
    (Robin Sommer)

  * Python 2.4 compat changes. (Jon Siwek)

  * When in brief mode, btest-diff now shows full output if we don't
    have a baseline yet. (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding executable permission back to script. (Robin Sommer)

  * Cleaning up distribution. (Robin Sommer)

0.22-28 | 2011-09-15 15:18:11 -0700

  * New environment variable TEST_DIFF_BRIEF. If set btest-diff no
    longer includes a mismatching file's full content it the
    diagnostic output. This can be useful if the file being compared
    is very large. (Robin Sommer)

0.22-27 | 2011-08-12 22:56:12 -0700

  * Fix btest-bg-wait's kill trap and -k option. (Jon Siwek)

0.22-18 | 2011-07-23 11:54:07 -0700

  * A new option -u for interactively updating baselines.

  * Teach btest's TEST-START-FILE to make subdirectories (Jon Siwek)

  * Output polishing. (Robin Sommer)

  * Have distutils install 'btest-setsid' script. (Jon Siwek)

  * A portable setsid. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fixes for background execution of processes.

  * Fixing exit codes. (Robin Sommer)

0.22-6 | 2011-07-19 17:38:03 -0700

  * Teach btest's TEST-START-FILE to make subdirectories (Jon Siwek)

0.22-5 | 2011-05-02 08:41:34 -0700

  * A number of bug fixes, and output polishing. (Robin Sommer)

  * More robust background execution by btest-bg-*. (Robin Sommer)

0.22-4 | 2011-03-29 21:38:13 -0700

  * A test command can now signal to btest that even if it fails
    subsequent test commands should still run by returning exit code 100.
    btest-diff uses this to continue in the case that no baseline has
    yet been established.

  * New test option @TEST-REQUIRES for running a test conditionally.
    See the README for more information.

0.22-2 | 2011-03-03 21:44:18 -0800

  * Two new helper scripts for spawning processes in the background.
    See README for more information.

  * btest-diff can now deal with files specificied with paths.

0.22 | 2011-02-08 14:06:13 -0800

  * BTest is now hosted along with the other Bro repositories on
    git.bro-ids.org.

0.21 | 2011-01-09 21:29:18 -0800

  * In btest.cfg, option values can now include commands to execute in
    backticks.

    Example:

        [environment]
        CC=clang -emit-llvm -g `hilti-config --cflags`

  * Limiting substitutions to replacing whole words.

  * Adding "substitutions". Substitutions are similar to filters, yet
    they do not adapt the input but the command line being exectued.
    See README for more information.

  * Instead of giving a test's file name on the command line, one can
    now also use its "dotted" name as it's printed out when btest is
    running (e.g., "foo.bar"). That allows for easier copy/paste.

  * Starting CHANGES.
